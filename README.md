# rust project

- arrays
  - to change an array:
    - Make the array mutable with mut.
    - Initialize the array anew with the changed values.
- learned how to use the sortby function
  - using the partial cmp function on and a while arguing with b
- pattern matchig with strings
  - use .as_str() on the matching one
- modularization: you must include "mod filename" within the main.rs file
  - and then when you want to use it in a sibling file, you must use "use create::filename"
